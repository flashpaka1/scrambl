Scrambl is a stack-based esoteric programming language designed for making programming a little more eggcelent

| Instruction       | Description                                                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| CRACK n           | Pushes the value n onto the stack.                             |
| SERVE             | Pops and prints the top value of the stack.                    |
| BEAT              | Adds the top two values on the stack.                          |
| STRAIN            | Subtracts the top value from the second value on the stack.    |
| MAKEANOMELETTE    | Multiplies the top two values on the stack.                    |
| SCRAMBLE          | Divides the second value by the top value on the stack.        |
| CRY               | Terminate program execution.                                   |
| INCUBATE          | Copies the top value of the stack and pushes it onto the stack.|
| FLIP              | Reverses the input here to push it in correct order.           |
| FRY               | Pops the top value of the stack and prints it as an ASCII character.|
| POACH             | Pops the top value of the stack and prints it as an integer.  |
| BURN              | Clears the stack.                                              |
| BATCH n           | Repeats the top value of the stack n times as an ASCII character.|
| OVEREASY n        | Repeats the top value of the stack n times as an integer.     |
| EAT               | Takes user input and pushes its ASCII code onto the stack.     |
| ORDER             | Takes string input and pushes its ASCII codes onto the stack.  |
| BOIL              | Prints without newline and space between characters            |
